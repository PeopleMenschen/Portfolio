                <h2 class="info-title">Brief Self-Introduction</h2>
                <p>I am an assistant electrician specializing in building and installation electrical systems, with 1.5 years of specialized electrical training in Germany (incomplete vocational program) and 2 years of hands-on experience on real-world projects. During this time, I have supported electrical installations in residential buildings, industrial facilities, and government offices as an assistant and helper.</p>

                <p>I am a hardworking, responsible, and organized individual, with professional working proficiency in German (B2) and basic knowledge of English (A2). My goal is to establish a stable, long-term working relationship with companies and organizations that value workplace safety and employee development and are seeking a reliable, trainable team member.</p>

                <h2 class="info-title">Core Skills and Foundational Training</h2>
                <p>- Combined theoretical and practical training in classroom and workshop settings  <br> - Familiarity with building wiring principles, control panels for residential and industrial electrical systems, and electrical safety standards  <br> - Strengthened foundational technical skills tailored to residential and building installation projects </p>
            <p>I also possess basic electrical knowledge, including the ability to perform simple calculations and cost estimations for small-scale projects. Additionally, I have practical welding skills, which I can apply when needed as a complementary capability.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- My Motivation section -->
            <div class="info-section">
                <h2 class="info-title">My Motivation</h2>
                <p>I have followed my professional path in the electrical field with honesty and realism. During my time at work and school, despite receiving training and being present in formal environments, I was not always able to clearly and simply understand the overall structure of electrical systems, the logic behind installations, and the connection between different components. Instead of seeing this as a weakness, it gradually became a strong motivation for independent learning.</p>

                <p>For this reason, a significant part of the technical and practical understanding presented in my portfolio has been developed through self-directed practice at home. Outside classrooms and workshops, I used my personal time to practice, analyze electrical panels, review real projects, and repeat tasks until I reached a level of understanding that was clear, logical, and practical for me.</p>

                <p>My focus has never been only on completing tasks, but on understanding why and how things work. I have consistently aimed to build a solid foundation in safety principles, system structure, execution order, and the logic of residential and light industrial electrical projects, even when this required extra time and effort.</p>
                <p>I believe that a professional who learns through personal motivation and discipline becomes more responsible, precise, and capable of long-term growth in the workplace. My goal is not short-term employment, but to become a reliable and value-creating team member who can grow with the organization.</p>
                <p>This portfolio reflects my learning journey—a path shaped by honesty, continuous practice, and genuine interest in the electrical profession, and one that is still ongoing.</p>

                <h2 class="info-title">🚀 My Outlook on the Future | Technology, Learning & Professional Growth</h2>
                <p>The field of electrical installations and building services is undergoing a major transformation, where traditional electrical systems are increasingly integrated with smart technologies, digitalization, and data-driven solutions. I have consciously aligned my professional development with this evolution through continuous and structured learning.</p>

                <p>Alongside strengthening my core skills in residential and light industrial electrical work, I am highly interested in modern concepts such as smart building systems (Smart Home), basic automation, energy monitoring and efficiency, and the logical structure of modern electrical distribution panels, which I pursue step by step.</p>

                <p>I also consider complementary fields such as:    <br>- System thinking and small-scale technical project management <br>- Basic understanding of programming logic for control systems <br>- Structured technical design and documentation <br>- Use of digital tools and specialized software</p>
                <p>as essential future skills. These competencies help transform a technical assistant from a task executor into a valuable contributor to optimization, planning, and decision-support processes.</p>
                <p>From my perspective, a valuable professional is someone who grows alongside technological progress, takes responsibility for their own learning, and remains adaptable to future organizational needs. My goal is to develop into such a professional—motivated, flexible, and reliable in the evolving electrical industry.</p>
